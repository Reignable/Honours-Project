	\begin{comment}
	The purpose of this section is to introduce the concepts of mountain bike suspension setup and indicate why this may be difficult for a less knowledgeable individuals. It will then continue to identify and explain common image analysis techniques and how they may be applied to mountain bike suspension setup.

	The aim of this project is to produce an application that makes use of image analysis techniques to provide the user with a suggested set-up for their suspension units. This literature review will identify the intricacies involved in correctly configuring a rear suspension unit and how these make it difficult for riders to do it themselves. It will then go on to highlight how image analysis is carried out and identify the various techniques that are relevant to this project. This review will shed light on the problem at hand and help identify a viable solution.

	\subsection{Conclusion}
	By identifying the key aspects and settings relating to mountain bike suspension and the common image analysis techniques this literature review has highlighted the processes which this project can utilise to complete its aims. By using this knowledge, the following sections will identify distinct methods which the project will use to produce the application and cover the results. \todo{revise}

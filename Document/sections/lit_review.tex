\section{Literature Review}\label{sec:lit_review}
	The aim of this project is to produce an application that makes use of image analysis techniques to provide the user with a suggested set-up for their suspension units. This literature review will identify the intricacies involved in correctly configuring a rear suspension unit and how these make it difficult for riders to do it themselves. It will then go on to highlight how image analysis is carried out and identify the various techniques that are relevant to this project. This review will shed light on the problem at hand and help identify a viable solution.

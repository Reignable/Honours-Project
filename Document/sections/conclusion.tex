\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
	This section will conclude the project by evaluating how well the original aims have been met to determine the success of the project, compare the prototype application to current products on the market, and outline any future work which can be potentially completed in subsequent projects. Finally a self appraisal will be carried out to discuss this author's performance during the project.
	\subsection{Meeting Aims}
		% How well does the solution relate to the original aims and objectives
			% Very well
			% Still requires some user work, not a massive issue, refer back to comparison to alternatives eval seciton
			% Talk about how figures are close on the HV shock and how the measurement lies outside the plot
	\subsection{Comparison to other Products}
		% Fox is locked to their product, requires lots of alignment
		% Shockwiz, needs to be ridden and attached, expensive
	\subsection{Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion_future_work}
		% Make into app
			% Python wrapper
			% Ref back to experiments on difficulties
		% Make work for all shocks
		% Make work for front suspension
		% Add rebound and compression (database)
		% Coil
	\subsection{Self Appraisal}
		% Strengths
		% Weaknesses
		% Talk about improving commit messages

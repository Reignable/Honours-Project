\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
	This section will conclude the project by evaluating how well the original aims have been met to determine the success of the project, compare the prototype application to current products on the market, and outline any future work which can be potentially completed in subsequent projects. Finally a self appraisal will be carried out to discuss this author's performance during the project.
	% General conclusion
	\subsection{Meeting Aims}
		% How well does the solution relate to the original aims and objectives
			% Very well
		As a measure of success the original project aims which, were explained in section \ref{sec:aims_and_objectives}, can be examined to see if they have been met upon project completion. 
		\subsubsection{Aim 1}
			The first aim was to complete a literature review of mountain bike suspension and image analysis techniques including how image analysis is currently used in sports science which has been met by section \ref{sec:lit_review}. This literature review presented the fundamentals of mountain bike suspension to provide insight into its operation as a way of building knowledge of the project context. The research into image analysis uses and techniques proved useful in deciding how the application would operate which aided the development process, particularly when issues appeared with the measurement technique and reference point finding methods.
		\subsubsection{Aim 2}
			The second aim was to implement the prototype application using identified and researched methods. This aim has been met using methods selected from those outlined in section \ref{sec:methodology} and the resulting application is documented in section \ref{sec:results}.

			% Dev process
			% Other PM, git, gantt
			% Platform, testing
		\subsubsection{Aim 3}
			% Evaluation of different metrics completed
			% Proves the application works as expected, produces good results, and is well received
			Evaluate the success and appropriateness of the produced application
		\subsubsection{Aim 4}
			% Done in this section
			The final aim was to present conclusions about the project's successes and downfalls which is shown in the present section.
	\subsection{Comparison to other Products}
		% Fox is locked to their product, requires lots of alignment
		% Shockwiz, needs to be ridden and attached, expensive
	\subsection{Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion_future_work}
		% Make into app
			% Python wrapper
			% Ref back to experiments on difficulties
		% Add functionality (Specify pressures, different units)
		% Make work for all shocks
		% Make work for front suspension
		% Add rebound and compression (database)
		% Coil
	\subsection{Self Appraisal}
		% Strengths
		% Weaknesses
		% Talk about improving commit messages

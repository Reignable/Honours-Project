\subsection{Image Analysis for Optimizing Mountain Bike Suspension}
	Though image analysis has been used for calculations in many engineering and sports applications \citep{concreteanalysis, bridgecables}, it is relatively unused with mountain bike suspension with only the specialists at Fox Racing Shox using the technology \citep{foxird}. The mobile application that Fox has locks to the forks and shocks that the company manufacture although the image analysis techniques they use are adaptable enough to be used on suspension units from other manufacturers.

	By harnessing the image capturing and computing power of modern smartphones, image analysis can be applied to mountain bike suspension to produce a simple method of calculating a baseline setup for any suspension unit. The measurements and calculations required can be removed from the userâ€™s responsibility to create a simple and efficient method of generating a safe and reliable suspension setup.

\subsection{Using Image Analysis for Mountain Bike Suspension}
Though image analysis has been used for calculations in many engineering and sports applications \citep{concreteanalysis, bridgecables}, it is relatively unused with mountain bike suspension with only Fox Racing Shox using the technology for setup purposes \citep{foxird}. The mobile application which Fox created is locked to \glspl{fork} and \glspl{shock} that the company manufacture though image analysis techniques are adaptable enough to be used on any suspension unit.

By harnessing the image capturing and computing power of modern smartphones, image analysis can be applied to mountain bike suspension to produce a simple method of calculating a baseline setup for any suspension unit. The measurements and calculations required can be removed from the user's responsibility creating a simple and efficient method of generating a safe and reliable suspension setup.

### Project Management
#### Alternative approach
 - Small project so could be overmanaged
 - Allows for easier problem solving
 - Could cause project to run out of time easily

#### Threshold

### Evaluation
#### Validation
 - Manually calcualte settings for different sag values
 - Produce same with application
 - Compare

#### Reliability
 - Take multiple values produced using same images
 - Calculate deviation to decide how good it is
 - Standard deviation

#### Manual Comparison
 - Do the calculation manually and compare the results

#### Professional Opinion
 - Ask what they think
 - Would they consider reccomending it

## Results
 ### Deviation from Plan
  - Organic dev approach
  - Discussion of hough circles vs contours
  - Oring finding method
  - Plotting vs psi per mm
  - EXIF vs ref point
 ### System
  #### Description of System
   - Side by side images and schematic explaining method
  #### Pseudocode
 ### Evaluation
  #### Deviation
   - Calculate
  #### Validation
   - Compare results to manual setup
  #### Professional Opinion
 - Pedals
      - Would need to be an app for people to use it
      - Overall good, produces expected outputs

## Conclusions
 ### Meeting aims
  - How well does the solution relate to the original aims and objectives
 ### Compare to other products
  - Fox is locked to their product, requires lots of alignment
  - Shockwiz, needs to be ridden and attached, expensive
 ### Future Work
  - Make into app
  - Python wrapper
  - Make work for all shocks
  - Make work for front suspension
  - Add rebound and compression (database)
  - Coil
 ### Self Appraisal

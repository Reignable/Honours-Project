As a <usertype>, I want <function>, so that <value>.

As a new rider,         I want to be able to easily produce baseline settings for my bike,  so that I do not need to lean what each setting does.
As a careful user,      I want assurance that my setting will be correct,                   so that I do not damage my bike.
As an inquisitive user, I want to be able to know what changing each setting does,          so that I can make adjustments myself and play with the settings.
